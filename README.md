### Task 1: `processArray`
- **File**: `arrayManipulation.js`
- **Description**: This function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: Add a `formatArrayStrings` function to `arrayManipulation.js`
**File** : `arrayManipulation.js`
**Description**: formatArrayStrings function takes two arrays as arguments (an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`) and modifies each string based on its corresponding number thus capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3: Create a file named `userInfo.js` with a `createUserProfiles` function that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2 and returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
